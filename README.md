# Peters-Noteskins
Peter's noteskins for StepMania. (also Simply Love fonts & judgements and SMX gifs I made).
(TODO """eventually""" this read-me will have a list of all my noteskins including image previews)

All my noteskins are public domain under the Unlicense. In simple terms, I do not give *half a flying fuck* about how my noteskins are used, shared, modified, sold as merchandise, with or without credit. I could not care less. Anyone is free to do whatever with them as long as they remain in the public domain.


**Open-ITG**<br>
works with Stepmania 3.95 and Open-ITG
You'll find mostly just legacy noteskins in here that I no longer work on.

**Not-ITG**<br>
Based off the Open-ITG noteskins except uses (doubleres) graphics.
Again, noteskins in here I believe are complete and am unlikely to work on them again.

**SM5**<br>
Works with StepMania 5 and Etterna.
SM5 is what I mainly focus on now. Here you'll find a lot more options.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**SM5\Completed**<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Noteskins I consider completed and am unlikely to work on again unless I do a big overhaul on their lua code or something.<br><br>

*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Something I very commonly do is add optional alternative textures inside my noteskins called something like 'Tap Note parts_DevCel (Rename Me To Activate).png'. To activate, you'd have to rename or delete the existing 'Tap Notes parts.png', I personally rename to 'Tap Notes parts_original.png'. And then rename 'Tap Note parts_DevCel (Rename Me To Activate).png' to 'Tap Notes parts.png'. This way you'll get to activate an alternative look for that noteskin.*

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**SM5\Legacy**<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very old noteskins I no longer think about or would consider myself using.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Placing them here for archiving reasons mostly or if someone's actually into one of my older works.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**SM5\Simply-Love-Assets**<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Judgements and Fonts I did for Simply Love or themes based off of Simply Love.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**SM5\WIP**<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Noteskins I considered unfinished. Am I planning on finishing them? At some point maybe lmao.

**SMX-gifs**<br>
GIF files I made for the StepManiaX dance platform.
