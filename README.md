# Peters-Noteskins
Peter's noteskins for StepMania.

All my noteskins are public domain under the Unlicense. In simple terms, I do not give *half a flying fuck* about how my noteskins are used, shared, modified, sold as merchandise, with or without credit. I could not care less. Anyone is free to do whatever with them as long as they remain in the public domain.


**Open-ITG**<br>
works with Stepmania 3.95 and Open-ITG
You'll find mostly just legacy noteskins in here that I no longer work on.

**Not-ITG**<br>
Based off the Open-ITG noteskins except uses (doubleres) graphics.
Again, noteskins in here I believe are complete and am unlikely to work on them again.

**SM5**<br>
Works with StepMania 5 and Etterna.
SM5 is what I mainly focus on now. Here you'll find a lot more options.
