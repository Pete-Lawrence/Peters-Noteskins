# Peters-DDR-Note
The goal of this noteskin is to be as close to 1:1 to the DDR noteskin as possible with minor improvements, like less colour banding on the gradients.

Before the song starts, the receptor arrows need to show their Wait graphic.

When an arrow is stepped on, the receptor needs to play this command regardless of what judgement is recieved if any (currently it's completely wrong):
function(self):zoom(0.9):sleep(2/60):linear(4/60):zoom(2.0)

Down Flash Bright.png graphic probably could be more faithful.

judgement colours and explosions could be re-examined. Not 100% sure with them yet.

Shock Arrows could be added too I guess.

Roll heads are broken lmao.
