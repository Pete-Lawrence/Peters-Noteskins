# Peters-DDR-Note
The goal of this noteskins is to be as close to 1:1 to the DDR noteskin as possible with minor improvements, like less colour banding on the gradients.

Before the song starts, the receptor arrows need to show their Wait graphic.

When an arrow is stepped on, the receptor needs to play this command regardless of what judgement is recieved if any
<code>function(self):zoom(0.9):sleep(2/60):linear(4/60):zoom(2.0)</code>

Shock Arrows could be added too I guess.
