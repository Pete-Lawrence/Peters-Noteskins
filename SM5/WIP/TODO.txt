The goal of this noteskin is to be as close to 1:1 to the DDR noteskin as possible with minor improvements, like less colour banding on the gradients.
Rainbow Correctly displays 16th notes before 8th notes as pink, and 16th notes after 8th notes as purple!

Shock Arrow explosion slightly WIP as this graphic isn't complete "Fallback HitMine3 Explosion 4x2 (res 256x128).png"

Also Downscroll, the Holds and Rolls need to be displayed properly.

And Active Holds need a 3 frame fade-in animation to match DDR.
