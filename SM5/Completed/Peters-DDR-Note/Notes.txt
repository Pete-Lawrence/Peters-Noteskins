The goal of this noteskin is to be as close to 1:1 to the DDR noteskin as possible with minor improvements, like less colour banding on the gradients.

Rainbow Correctly displays 16th notes before 8th notes as pink, and 16th notes after 8th notes as purple!

Unfortunately breaks using Downscroll. The Holds and Rolls aren't displayed properly.

A few differences from DDR, DDR Active Holds have a 3 frame fade-in animation.
DDR Freeze Arrows without a tail (Jumps) should emit a yellow Marvelous flash when hit but I don't think StepMania can mimic this behaviour.
